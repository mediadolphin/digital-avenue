# Bricks: role permissions (via MCP)

Bricks builder access is not stored in `bricks_global_settings`.

It has two real stores:

1. Custom builder capability definitions live in `BRICKS_DB_CAPABILITIES_PERMISSIONS` (`bricks_capabilities_permissions`). Each row is `{ label, description, permissions }` and is keyed by a WordPress capability id.
2. Role access lives on WordPress roles. A role gets builder access when it has `bricks_edit_content`, `bricks_full_access`, or a custom builder capability id.

Use the dedicated permission abilities. Do not use `bricks/set-global-settings` for builder permissions.

These tools are default off in `Bricks > AI` because they can change builder access for WordPress roles. If `bricks-list-ability-status` reports `enabled: false` for this category, ask a human admin to opt in before continuing.

## Abilities

These are long-tail abilities. If the direct hyphenated tool is not available, call them through `mcp-adapter-execute-ability`.

- `bricks/list-builder-permissions`: read permission sections, default/custom capability definitions, role assignments, and the capability choices shown in the Builder access role select.
- `bricks/upsert-builder-capability`: create or update one custom builder capability definition.
- `bricks/set-builder-role-access`: assign existing builder access capabilities to WordPress roles. Empty string means no builder access. `administrator` is not writable because Bricks always treats administrators as full access.
- `bricks/delete-builder-capability`: delete one custom capability definition and remove that WordPress capability from all roles.

## Permission keys

Source of truth: `includes/builder-permissions.php`.

Do not guess keys. Start with `bricks/list-builder-permissions` and use the returned `permissionSections`.

Common sections:

- Post type access: `access_builder_{post_type}`, for example `access_builder_page`.
- General: `access_breakpoints_manager`, `access_page_settings`, `access_template_settings`, `access_revisions`, `delete_revisions`, `access_font_manager`, `access_icon_manager`.
- Templates: `create_templates`, `edit_templates`, `delete_templates`, `insert_templates`, `access_remote_templates`, `import_export_templates`.
- Global styles and settings: `edit_color_palettes`, `access_class_manager`, `access_variable_manager`, `access_theme_styles`, `access_query_manager`, `create_global_classes`, `edit_global_classes`, `delete_global_classes`, `assign_unassign_global_classes`, `lock_unlock_global_classes`, `copy_paste_global_classes_styles`, `access_pseudo_selectors`.
- Components: `insert_components`, `set_component_props`, `edit_components`, `create_components`, `delete_components`, `import_export_components`.
- Element editing: `access_element_content`, `access_element_styles`, `access_query_loop_builder`, `access_element_hide`, `access_element_conditions`, `access_element_interactions`, `duplicate_elements`, `delete_elements`, `move_elements`, `copy_paste_elements`, `copy_paste_element_styles`, `copy_paste_element_conditions`, `copy_paste_element_interactions`, `copy_paste_element_attributes`, `pin_unpin_elements`.
- Element-specific permissions are generated from registered elements: `add_element_{elementName}` and `edit_element_{elementName}`.

Keys such as `use_builder`, `template_manager`, `upload_json`, `use_components`, and `use_global_elements` are not current builder permission keys unless `list-builder-permissions` returns them.

## Create a custom access level

Create a capability definition first:

```json
{
  "ability_name": "bricks/upsert-builder-capability",
  "parameters": {
    "id": "bricks_marketer_access",
    "label": "Marketing access",
    "description": "Can edit content and insert templates, without design-system management.",
    "permissions": [
      "access_builder_page",
      "access_element_content",
      "access_revisions",
      "insert_templates"
    ]
  }
}
```

The id is a WordPress capability id. It must not be `bricks_full_access`, `bricks_edit_content`, or `bricks_no_access`.

## Assign roles

Assign an existing builder access capability to each role you want to change:

```json
{
  "ability_name": "bricks/set-builder-role-access",
  "parameters": {
    "roleAccess": {
      "editor": "bricks_marketer_access",
      "author": ""
    }
  }
}
```

The response includes `beforeSnapshot` and the resulting `roleAccess`. Report both when the change affects a real site.

## Code execution stays out of MCP

`executeCodeEnabled` and `executeCodeCapabilities` are excluded from Bricks settings abilities. The actual WP capabilities are `bricks_execute_code` and `bricks_execute_code_off` (`includes/capabilities.php`). These control custom PHP through echo tags, Code element PHP mode, SVG source code, and Custom Query PHP.

Raising code execution is a direct RCE boundary. If a task needs it, tell the user to change it in the Bricks admin UI.

## Do not

- Do not use `bricks/set-global-settings` for builder permissions.
- Do not send made-up permission keys. Read `list-builder-permissions` first.
- Do not assign a custom capability id before creating it.
- Do not try to change administrator builder access through MCP.
- Do not flip code-execution capabilities through MCP.
