# Bricks: query filters

Query Filters are the AJAX-driven faceted-filtering system Bricks introduced in 1.11. They look simple (drag an element, pick options) and fail silently (filter renders, nothing happens on click) because they depend on an index that isn't built automatically for custom fields, and on a target-query binding that isn't obvious. Use it to keep filter setup accurate.

## The 8 filter elements

Defined at `includes/query-filters.php:705-716` and `includes/elements/filter-*.php`.

| Element | `$name` | Use when | Filter type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Filter - Checkbox | `filter-checkbox` | Multi-select values, taxonomies | `checkbox` |
| Filter - Radio | `filter-radio` | Single-select value | `radio` |
| Filter - Select | `filter-select` | Single-select dropdown | `select` |
| Filter - Range | `filter-range` | Numeric range (price, rating) | `range` |
| Filter - Search | `filter-search` | Text search across fields | `search` |
| Filter - Datepicker | `filter-datepicker` | Date range filter | `datepicker` |
| Filter - Submit / Reset | `filter-submit` | Explicit submit/reset button (non-live forms) | `apply` or `reset` (via `filterButtonType`) |
| Filter - Active Filters | `filter-active-filters` | Shows currently-active filters as chips | `active-filters` |

Every filter element extends `Filter_Element_Base` in `includes/elements/filter-base.php`.

## The target-query binding: the most-missed setting

Every filter element has a **`filterQueryId`** setting pointing at the query-element `_id` it filters. Without it, the filter does nothing: no error, no warning. The dropdown in the builder is labelled **"Target query"** and lists all query-producing elements on the page.

Where it lives: `filter-base.php:1100-1108`, control type `query-list`.

**Rules:**
- The target element must exist on the same page (header/footer queries can be targeted from the page if they're visible in the tree).
- The target must be a query-producing element: Posts, Users, Terms, Container/Block/Section/Div with query-loop enabled.
- Setting the target on one filter doesn't set it on sibling filters: each filter needs its own `filterQueryId`.
- MCP: `set-filter-target-query` updates this on one filter; `update-filter-element` can update it alongside other config.

## The filter index: required for custom fields

Filters that populate options from the database need indexed values. Bricks maintains table `{prefix}bricks_filters_index` (defined at `query-filters.php:7`).

**Indexable filter types** (`query-filters.php:740-748`): `checkbox`, `radio`, `select`, `range`, `datepicker`. Not indexable: `search`, `submit`, `active-filters`.

**Index triggers:** Bricks hooks post, term, user, and meta changes while Query Filters are enabled: `save_post`, `delete_post`, `set_object_terms`, `updated_post_meta`, `deleted_post_meta`, `edit_attachment`, `edited_term`, `delete_term`, `profile_update`, `user_register`, and `delete_user`. It also watches Bricks-content meta writes through `update_post_metadata` / `added_post_meta` so filter elements stay registered.

**Manual reindex:** `WP Admin > Bricks > Settings > Query filters > Regenerate filter index` (fires `wp_ajax_bricks_reindex_query_filters`). The request recreates the index table and queues index jobs, so large sites may keep indexing after the request returns. Needed after:
- Bulk-importing posts / users / terms (the triggers fire per-item but may be slow or skipped in bulk imports).
- Enabling a new filter on an existing field.
- Changing the indexed field's structure.

**Serialized meta values:** if the meta field stores serialized data (PHP-serialized array / JSON blob), filters can't index it as separate selectable values unless something expands it into rows. `bricks/query_filters/custom_field_index_rows` can do that for non-native providers such as ACF or Meta Box. Current source only applies that filter when `$provider !== 'none'`; plain native post meta is stored as one raw value by `generate_custom_field_index_rows()` (`includes/query-filters.php:1975-2024`).

```php
add_filter( 'bricks/query_filters/custom_field_index_rows', function( $rows, $object_id, $meta_key, $provider, $object_type ) {
    if ( $meta_key !== 'my_array_field' || $object_type !== 'post' ) return $rows;

    $raw = get_post_meta( $object_id, $meta_key, true );
    $decoded = maybe_unserialize( $raw );

    if ( ! is_array( $decoded ) ) return $rows;

    return array_map( fn( $v ) => [
        'filter_value' => $v,
        'filter_value_display' => $v,
    ], $decoded );
}, 10, 5 );
```

## Data sources

Every filter has a **`filterSource`** setting (`filter-base.php:1184+`). Core Bricks registers three sources:

| Source | Setting keys | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `taxonomy` | `filterTaxonomy`, `filterTermInclude`, `filterTermExclude`, `filterTaxonomyOrder`, `filterTaxonomyOrderBy` | WP taxonomies (category, post_tag, product_cat, custom taxonomies) |
| `wpField` | `sourceFieldType` (post/user/term), `wpPostField` / `wpUserField` / `wpTermField` | Native WP fields: post_author, post_date, user_role, etc. |
| `customField` | `sourceFieldType`, `customFieldKey`, label mapping | ACF / Meta Box / Pods / native meta keys |

WooCommerce adds `wcField` when its query-filter integration is active (`includes/integrations/query-filters/woocommerce.php:22-85`).

Custom providers can be registered via `bricks/filter_element/data_source_{source_key}`: see the `bricks-hooks-reference` skill.

## Frontend handshake: what actually happens on click

1. User clicks a filter option.
2. Bricks frontend JS reads filter instances from `window.bricksData.filterInstances` and the selected filter state.
3. It POSTs JSON to the Bricks REST endpoint `query_result` with `queryElementId`, `postId`, selected filters, original query vars, language, and template context (`src/assets/js/frontend.js:13313-13370`).
4. `Api::render_query_result()` runs the target query with the filter's meta_query / tax_query injected (`includes/api.php:1490-1530`).
5. Returns HTML for the target query's loop. Frontend swaps it in, updates URL via pushState.

**The 3 conditions the target query must meet for AJAX swap to work:**
1. The query loop emits Bricks loop markers. Current source adds `data-brx-loop-start` on server render and frontend JS converts it to `<!--brx-loop-start-{queryId}-->`.
2. No optimizer or cache layer removes those markers. Preserve Bricks `brx-loop` markers in HTML optimization settings.
3. The target query's `_id` actually matches what the filter sent. This can break after duplicating a component or section that contains the query.

## Components and filter targets

Current Bricks has component-aware query-loop handling: query trails can carry `data-query-component-id`, and frontend AJAX uses that component id when locating the loop DOM (`includes/elements/base.php:4163-4168`, `src/assets/js/frontend.js:2157-2210`).

Still, a filter only works when its `filterQueryId` points to a query instance present on the rendered page. If a component instance contains a filter but not the matching query, the filter has no usable target. Prefer keeping the filter and its target query together at the page/template level, or ship them together inside the same component.

## Scope rule: "Use query filter" on the source loop

Some loops need explicit opt-in for filter compatibility: primarily **nested loops and loops populated via `bricks/query/run`**. The flag `useQueryFilter` lives on the query-producing element. For standard Posts/Users/Terms loops at the page level, the flag is typically on by default.

If your filter UI renders but the target loop doesn't swap: check the target loop's settings panel for a "Use query filters" / "Filterable" toggle and enable it.

## Hooks: when the UI isn't enough

| Hook | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `bricks/filter_element/controls` | filter | Mutate the builder controls for all filters |
| `bricks/filter_element/populated_options` | filter | Mutate the option list after population |
| `bricks/filter_element/data_source_{source}` | filter | Register/mutate a custom data source |
| `bricks/filter_element/count_source_{source}` | filter | Custom per-source count for result-count display |
| `bricks/filter_element/filtered_source` | filter | Final filtered source |
| `bricks/query_filters/custom_field_meta_query` | filter | Customize meta_query for custom-field filters |
| `bricks/query_filters/range_custom_field_meta_query` | filter | Same for range filters |
| `bricks/query_filters/datepicker_custom_field_meta_query` | filter | Same for datepicker filters |
| `bricks/query_filters/custom_field_index_rows` | filter | Expand serialized/array meta into index rows |
| `bricks/query_filters/get_filter_object_ids` | filter | Object IDs a filter restricts to |
| `bricks/filter/taxonomy_args` | filter | Args for taxonomy term query |
| `bricks/filter_element/datepicker_db_date_format` | filter | DB date format for datepicker |

See the `bricks-hooks-reference` skill for the full index.

## Silent-failure debug order

1. **Filter renders but nothing happens on click?**
   a. Open DevTools Network tab, click a filter option. Do you see a POST to the Bricks REST `query_result` endpoint? No -> frontend JS broken (check for JS errors, conflicting scripts).
   b. Request fires but returns empty HTML -> `filterQueryId` doesn't match any query on the page, or target query has no results with the filter applied.
   c. Request succeeds, HTML comes back, but DOM doesn't update -> loop-marker stripping or target mismatch. Check source for `data-brx-loop-start` and the live DOM for `brx-loop-start`.

2. **Custom-field filter shows no options?**
   a. Run reindex: `WP Admin > Bricks > Settings > Query filters > Regenerate filter index`.
   b. If the field is serialized/array: hook `bricks/query_filters/custom_field_index_rows` to unpack.
   c. If the field was just added: save any post of that type once: that triggers per-post indexing.

3. **Filter options show but selecting them doesn't narrow results?**
   a. Wrong meta comparison: numeric field using string compare. Hook `bricks/query_filters/custom_field_meta_query` to fix.
   b. Values include whitespace / case mismatch: index holds one form, frontend sends another.

4. **"Active filters" element shows nothing even after filtering?**
   a. It needs its own `filterQueryId` set to the same target. It's not auto-bound.

5. **Works on one page, breaks on another?**
   a. Component duplication: the query `_id` drifted. Keep filters outside components.
   b. Header/footer loop targeted from a page, but header/footer render order doesn't include it on the archive. Move the target.

6. **Datepicker filter compares against the wrong format?**
   a. Hook `bricks/filter_element/datepicker_db_date_format` to match the stored format.

## MCP abilities for query filters

- `list-query-filters`: enumerate every filter element on a page, with target binding status.
- `get-filter-element`: full settings of one filter.
- `update-filter-element`: update any filter's config (source, options, target).
- `set-filter-target-query`: quick-path for the most common mistake (missing target binding).

The `bricks-query-loops` skill covers the source-loop side of filter/loop integration.

## Never do

- Expect a filter with no `filterQueryId` to work. It won't, and there's no error.
- Put filters inside components that might render on pages without their target query.
- Trust that a custom-field filter has options immediately after bulk-importing the field's data. Always reindex.
- Ship to production without verifying Bricks loop-marker preservation: the most common AJAX-break post-launch.
- Use `search` filters on large datasets without a proper search index (ElasticPress, Algolia). Bricks' default search is a `LIKE '%term%'` against post_title/post_content: slow on 10k+ rows.
