# Form field and action reference

Read the sections relevant to the field, action or failure being handled.

## The 18 field types

Defined at `includes/elements/form.php:179-198`. Stored in `settings.fields[]` as a repeater array. Each entry has `type` + type-specific keys.

| Type | Purpose | Key config keys |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | Email input | `label`, `placeholder`, `required`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern` |
| `text` | Single-line text | `label`, `placeholder`, `required`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `autocomplete` |
| `textarea` | Multi-line text | `label`, `placeholder`, `required`, `minLength`, `maxLength` |
| `richtext` | TinyMCE editor | `label`, `required`, `tinyMceShowMenuBar` |
| `tel` | Phone | Same as text, `autocomplete: tel` common |
| `number` | Numeric | `min`, `max`, `step` |
| `url` | URL | Pattern-validated by browser |
| `image` | Single image from media library | Requires logged-in user by default |
| `gallery` | Multiple images | Same as image, array result |
| `checkbox` | Multi-select or single consent box | `options` (newline-separated choices), `value` for default |
| `select` | Dropdown | `options`, `valueLabelOptions` if value != label |
| `radio` | Single-select group | `options`, `value` |
| `file` | File upload | `fileUploadAllowedTypes`, `fileUploadStorage` (media library / uploads folder), `fileUploadStorageDirectory` |
| `datepicker` | Flatpickr widget | `time` (boolean for time picker), DB format configurable |
| `password` | Password | `passwordToggle` adds show/hide icon |
| `rememberme` | "Stay signed in" checkbox | Only meaningful when Form is used for login |
| `html` | Static HTML injected between fields | No submit value; for section headings, consent copy, etc. |
| `hidden` | Hidden input | For honeypot (`isHoneypot`), dynamic-data value injection |

**Honeypot field**: set any field's `isHoneypot` to true. Must be `hidden` type in practice. Value stays empty via CSS; bots that autofill get rejected server-side via `bricks/element/form/honeypot/result`. Cheap and works.

**Field `id` key**: unique per field in the repeater. Bricks email/webhook placeholders use the bare field id: `{{abc123}}`. For file fields, `{{abc123:url}}`, `{{abc123:name}}`, `{{abc123:type}}`, `{{abc123:size}}`, and `{{abc123:id}}` read file properties.

**Field `name` attribute**: the `name` key controls the submitted HTML input name. Bricks maps custom names back to `form-field-{id}` internally, so email/webhook placeholders still use the field id, not the custom name. Placeholder matching uses word characters only (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`), so avoid relying on hyphenated placeholder names.

## The action pipeline

Actions run **in order** on submit, except `redirect`, which Bricks moves to the end before running actions (`includes/integrations/form/init.php:429-438`). Each built-in action is a class in `includes/integrations/form/actions/*.php` implementing `run()`. The current source lists 12 base actions in `includes/integrations/form/init.php::get_available_actions()`, plus `unlock-password-protection` when password protection is enabled and `save-submission` when form submissions are enabled.

| Action | What it does | Required settings |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | Sends email to admin. Can also send confirmation email when its confirmation settings are enabled. | Recipient, subject, body (supports `{{field_id}}` templating) |
| `webhook` | POSTs JSON to a URL | Webhook URL, body template |
| `redirect` | Server-side redirect on success | Target URL (supports dynamic data) |
| `custom` | Runs the built-in Custom action class, which fires `bricks/form/custom_action` | Your PHP callback handles it |
| `login` | Logs user in | Username/email + password field IDs, remember field ID (optional) |
| `registration` | Creates a WP user | Email + password fields, role setting |
| `lost-password` | Triggers password-reset email | Email field |
| `reset-password` | Completes password reset | Email + password + password-confirm fields |
| `create-post` | Creates a WP post | Post type, title field, content field, meta-key mappings |
| `update-post` | Updates an existing post | Post ID field (often hidden + dynamic), same mappings |
| `save-submission` | Saves to `bricks_form_submissions` table | Appears only when `Bricks > Settings > Form > Save submissions` is enabled; MCP setting writes create the table lazily if needed |
| `unlock-password-protection` | Unlocks the Bricks password-protection gate | Password field; appears when `passwordProtectionEnabled` is active |
| `mailchimp` | Adds subscriber to a Mailchimp list | Mailchimp API key (global setting), list ID, email field |
| `sendgrid` | Adds contact to SendGrid | SendGrid API key, list ID, email field |

**Order matters.** Bricks runs actions in the stored order after moving `redirect` to the end. If an action reports an error, processing stops through `maybe_stop_processing()`, so place validation-style custom actions before side-effect actions.

**Per-action conditions:** `settings.actionConditions` contains action rules with
`action`, `conditions` (`fieldId`, `compare`, optional `value`), and
`conditionsRelation` (`and` or `or`). Actions without rules run normally. Use
`get-element-schema` for `form` and request `actionConditions` before writing nested
rules; this is separate from element visibility conditions. Preserve other rules
when updating the array (`includes/elements/form.php`, form `Init::should_run_action`).

**Custom action registration:**

```php
add_action( 'bricks/form/action/my_action_key', function( $form ) {
    // Access fields
    $fields = $form->get_fields();
    $email = $fields['form-field-abc'] ?? '';
    // Access form settings
    $settings = $form->get_settings();
    // Set a failure message (shown to user)
    if ( ! $email ) {
        $form->set_result( [
            'action'  => 'my_action_key',
            'type'    => 'danger',
            'message' => 'Email is required.',
        ] );
        return;
    }
    // Success path: no set_result needed, success is default
} );
```

Then add `my_action_key` to the form's action list via the builder or `bricks/update-form-actions` MCP ability. The MCP write accepts custom action keys only when the matching `bricks/form/action/{key}` hook is already registered on the site.

For the built-in `custom` action, hook `bricks/form/custom_action` instead. For your own action keys, Bricks checks `has_action( "bricks/form/action/{$form_action}" )` and then fires that dynamic hook (`includes/integrations/form/init.php:439-466`). The form instance exposes getters such as `get_fields()`, `get_settings()`, `get_uploaded_files()`, `get_id()`, `get_post_id()`, and `set_result()` (`includes/integrations/form/init.php:571-596`).

## `{{field-id}}` vs `{{field-name}}` templating

Use the submitted field id in double braces:

- `{{abc123}}`: value for field id `abc123`
- `{{abc123:url}}`: URL property for an uploaded file field
- `{{all_fields}}`: all submitted fields in email content
- `{{referrer_url}}`: submitted referrer URL, undocumented but handled by source

After field placeholders are replaced, Bricks renders normal dynamic data such as `{post_title}` or `{site_title}` in subject, body, redirect URL, and webhook content. `admin_email` is an email-recipient option, not a `{admin_email}` dynamic-data tag.

For custom actions that forward submitted values into HTML, escape at that output boundary. The `bricks/form/response` filter changes the response after actions run; it is not an email-body sanitization hook.

## Submissions: the database toggle

Two conditions both required before submissions save:

1. `Bricks > Settings > Form > Save submissions` = **On** (site-level toggle, `saveFormSubmissions` in `Database::get_setting`).
2. The `save-submission` action is added to the form's action list.

Storage: custom table `{prefix}bricks_form_submissions` (`includes/integrations/form/submission-database.php:11-93`). Columns: `id, post_id, form_id, created_at, form_data (LONGTEXT JSON), browser, ip, os, referrer, user_id, status, favorite, info`.

- `form_id` = the Form element's `_id` (not a post id).
- `form_data` = JSON blob of all submitted fields keyed by field id.
- `status` defaults to `unread`.

**The `post_id` column is the page the form lived on at submit time**, not the post-type value for `create-post` actions. Don't confuse these.

Reading submissions from code:

```php
global $wpdb;
$rows = $wpdb->get_results( $wpdb->prepare(
    "SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}bricks_form_submissions WHERE form_id = %s ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50",
    $form_element_id
) );
```

Browse in UI: `WP Admin > Bricks > Form submissions`: visible only when the setting is on.

## Anti-spam: reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Turnstile, honeypot

Four anti-spam mechanisms, not mutually exclusive. Combine for production.

| Mechanism | Where configured | Gotcha |
|---|---|---|
| Honeypot field | Per form, `isHoneypot` on a hidden field | Free, works against dumb bots. Trivial to bypass for targeted scrapers. |
| reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible) | Same settings page | Score-based. Threshold tunable via `bricks/form/recaptcha_score_threshold` filter (default 0.5). |
| hCaptcha / Turnstile | Same settings page (different key fields) | Separate providers; use matching site and secret keys and enable the selected provider on the form. |

**Deferred Turnstile:** `turnstileInitialization` accepts `viewport` or `interaction`;
unset means page load. Both deferred modes also initialize on submit. In viewport
mode, `turnstileViewportDistance` is a pixel distance (0–5000, default 300). Keep
`enableTurnstile` and credentials configured; deferring initialization does not
remove validation. Check both first interaction and direct-submit behavior.

**reCAPTCHA setup:** native Bricks forms use reCAPTCHA v3. Server verification runs only when `enableRecaptcha` is present and the global site key is configured. Global keys alone do not protect a form; enable it on that form and test token verification (`includes/integrations/form/init.php`).

## SMTP: why emails silently drop

Bricks uses WordPress's `wp_mail()`. A successful handoff does not prove delivery. Check the configured mail transport and delivery logs for the failing message.

**Fix order:**
1. Install a transactional SMTP plugin (WP Mail SMTP, FluentSMTP, Post SMTP). Configure Postmark / SendGrid / Amazon SES / Mailgun.
2. From address: use your domain, not `wordpress@example.com`. Shared hosts reject that.
3. Test with the SMTP plugin's "send test email" first: confirm SMTP works in isolation before blaming the form.
4. If submissions save but emails do not arrive, inspect the email action result and mail-provider logs before attributing the failure.

**Debug hook:** inspect `bricks/form/response` for action errors without logging sensitive form data. A successful `wp_mail()` result indicates handoff, not inbox delivery; check transport and provider logs for the latter.

## Webhook action: the rate-limit trap

Webhooks POST to a configured URL as JSON or form-encoded data. With no custom data template, the payload is the submitted fields array, keyed by `form-field-{id}` plus any custom field names Bricks mapped during submit.

- Default timeout: 15 seconds. Filter with `bricks/webhook/timeout`.
- No built-in retry. If the endpoint returns an HTTP error or the request fails, the webhook action records an error unless the form has `webhookErrorIgnore` enabled (`includes/integrations/form/actions/webhook.php:202-239`). Log `bricks/form/response` or hook a custom action if you need more diagnostics.
- Without a custom data template, the payload starts as the submitted fields array (`form-field-{id}` keys, plus custom field names Bricks mapped back during submit) and adds uploaded-file metadata. With `contentType: json`, Bricks JSON-encodes that payload before sending.

```php
add_filter( 'bricks/webhook/timeout', function( $timeout ) {
    return $timeout;
} );
```

## Silent-failure debug order

When a form "doesn't work", use the observed symptom to choose these checks.

1. **Form didn't save?** Reload the builder, edit form, click Save. Un-saved builder state doesn't hit the frontend.
2. **Submission returned `success` but no email?** SMTP. Test via the SMTP plugin's test-send. (See SMTP section.)
3. **Submission returned error?** Check `bricks/form/response` or the browser Network tab. The response body names the failing action.
4. **`save-submission` enabled but nothing in the table?** Global `Save submissions` setting off, or `save-submission` action not added to the form.
5. **reCAPTCHA always fails?** Verify the configured keys are for reCAPTCHA v3 and the site domain is allowed in the provider settings.
6. **Custom action not firing?** If the action key is `custom`, hook `bricks/form/custom_action`. If it is your own key, the form action must match the `bricks/form/action/{key}` hook suffix exactly. Typos silently drop.
7. **File upload "failed"?** `fileUploadAllowedTypes` too narrow, PHP `upload_max_filesize` / `post_max_size` too small, or upload dir not writable.
8. **Field `name` is empty in email?** Either `name` attribute unset on the field (auto-generated fallback doesn't match the email template), or the email template references a different field id.

## Never do

- Build a login flow with a Form element on a public site without rate-limiting. Bricks doesn't rate-limit login attempts. Add a plugin (Limit Login Attempts Reloaded) or bail to WP's standard login.
- Trust `saveFormSubmissions` alone: you still need the `save-submission` action added to each form you want persisted.
- Hard-code API keys (Mailchimp / SendGrid) anywhere except `Bricks > Settings > API keys`. Use the supported credential settings; do not claim encryption at rest. Values are masked in the UI, and copying them into content can expose them in revisions.
- Put a password field in a form without also enabling HTTPS. Browsers warn users about non-HTTPS password forms; Bricks won't.
- Skip the `sanitize_*` step in a custom action that writes user input back anywhere. Bricks sanitizes for its own storage, not yours.

## Verification after editing a form

Read configuration before changing or submitting a form. Preserve existing field IDs,
actions and settings when adding one field. A submission can send email/webhooks,
create users/posts or trigger payments: use an authorized test destination and
fixture when execution is part of the request. Configuration review alone does not
authorize those effects.


1. Check the builder preview: the form renders, all fields visible.
2. When functional submission testing is authorized, submit to the agreed test destination from the frontend (not the builder). The builder is a preview context; submissions from inside it don't always process the full pipeline.
3. Watch `wp-content/debug.log` with `WP_DEBUG_LOG=true`: action failures log there.
4. Confirm the admin-side settings: `Bricks > Settings > API keys`, `Bricks > Settings > Form`.
5. If you have a submissions table, confirm one new row after a test submit.
