# Bricks: design system authoring

> **If a `bricks/*` ability is not available as a direct tool**: first check whether it is outside the fast path and call it through `mcp-adapter-execute-ability` with `ability_name: "bricks/<name>"`. If the dispatcher also rejects it, call `bricks-list-ability-status` to check whether a site admin disabled it under Bricks > AI.

## Before you write anything

Call `bricks/get-design-context`. You are looking for three answers:

1. Does a matching resource already exist? Reuse it.
2. Is there a convention to follow? (kebab-case classes, `--space-{size}` variable naming, t-shirt or numeric scale: match it.)
3. Are there empty slots? (Palette exists but one color is missing, scale exists but one step is missing.) Fill the slot instead of creating a new parallel resource.

Also inspect `variableCategories`. If a category already has a `scale` config, use that category ID and prefix. Do not create `fs-*` variables when the typography category prefix is `text-`, and do not hand-author static spacing/type values when a scale category exists.

**A fresh Bricks install can have no saved design-system resources**: no custom theme style, classes, components, or saved variables. Bricks still exposes a built-in default color palette fallback in the builder and in `list-color-palettes`; do not tell users Bricks has no default palette. If `get-design-context` returns empty, treat the editable design system as greenfield and seed it deliberately (see **bricks-seed-design-system** skill).

## Current write preconditions

Global design writes no longer share one coarse version precondition. Immediately
before a focused write, call the matching focused read and pass its complete returned
ownership data unchanged:

- Global classes: single `create-global-class` has no resource ownership parameter;
  pass `expectedCategoryOwnership` only when assigning a category.
  `batch-create-global-classes` requires resource `expectedOwnership` and category
  ownership when categorized. Updates/deletes require the target row's
  `itemOwnership` as `expectedOwnership` plus `lockOwnership`.
- Variables/categories: both `variableOwnership` and `categoryOwnership`; category
  writes replace the complete category list and must preserve opaque fields.
- Palettes/colors: resource `ownership` for creates and target `itemOwnership` for
  updates/deletes. Chain each successful response's new `ownership` into sequential
  palette mutations.
- Theme styles: use the target `itemOwnership` for update/delete. Fetch the specific
  style when editing settings; a summary digest still covers the complete hidden row.
- Components: update/delete still require `expectedDesignSystemVersion` and now also
  the complete current `expectedComponentDigest`.

Deletion acknowledgement flags (`allowOrphans`) are mandatory where documented and
do not replace ownership. On any stale precondition, re-read and rebase; do not
manufacture ownership data from `get-design-context.version`.

## Global classes

- Names must be **unique across all classes**. The write aborts with `bricks_conflict_duplicate_global_class_name` if the name is taken. Read the existing one before retrying.
- Keep names **kebab-case**, lowercase, no vendor prefixes. `.button`, `.card`, `.hero-text`. Not `btn_v2`, `Button`, `--hero-text`.
- Don't create modifier classes like `.button-red`: create a base class and a modifier class that sets only the color. Bricks supports class combinations natively.
- Class settings follow the same shape as element settings: call `bricks/render-elements` on a minimal element using the class to verify CSS output before committing settings programmatically.

## Global variables

- **Use the scale generator** (`bricks/generate-scale-variables`) for typography and spacing. Do not hand-author static spacing or type variables that match a configured scale prefix. The same generator handles **both** typography and spacing: it's one math model (fluid `clamp()` with slope) driven by the category config. There is no separate typography-scale tool.
- When `get-design-context.variableCategories` includes spacing or typography categories with `scale`, pass the existing `categoryId` to `generate-scale-variables`. The generated names inherit the configured prefix, such as `space-` or `text-`.
- The scale generator resolves the html base font-size from three sources in order: **style manager value -> theme styles -> `10px` default**. If your scale outputs unexpected pixel values, that order is why.
- Variable names must be unique **at save time**, but **the builder UI does not validate this on create**: call `list-global-variables` first and guard against duplicates before writing. Conflict returns `bricks_conflict_duplicate_global_variable_name` on save.
- Variables are referenced in CSS as `var(--{name})`. Use the bare name (`space-m`, not `--space-m`) when creating: Bricks adds the `--` prefix when emitting CSS.
- When building a fluid scale, use the Bricks scale shape. `category.scale` has **four keys the builder cannot work without**, plus the math knobs:
  - `scaleScope`: **`"typography"` or `"spacing"`, nothing else.** Style Manager has one fixed tab per scope and lists a category only when `scale.scaleScope` matches the open tab. Omit it and the scale still shows a "scale" badge in the Variable Manager, still blocks hand-authored values for its prefix, and still gets cascade-deleted with the category — but **Style Manager > Typography/Spacing will be empty and the user can never edit or regenerate it**.
  - `scaleNames`: the ordered step names, e.g. `["2xs","xs","s","m","l","xl","2xl"]`. **This list is the scale's extent.** `regenerateVariables()` (fires when the html font size or min/max screen width changes, and on import) derives each variable's step from its *index in this list*. Omit it and the baseline index collapses to `0`, silently rewriting every variable at the wrong step.
  - `baseline`: must be one of the `scaleNames` entries. Default t-shirt baseline is `m`.
  - `prefix`: e.g. `text-`, `space-`.
  - Math knobs: `scaleType` (`tshirt` | `numeric` | `custom`), `minFontSize`, `maxFontSize`, `minScaleRatio` / `minScaleRatioSelect`, `maxScaleRatio` / `maxScaleRatioSelect`. Note: `*ScaleRatioSelect` wins unless it is the literal string `"custom"`, in which case `*ScaleRatio` is used.
- **Keep `scaleRange` and `scaleNames` in agreement.** The builder generates exactly one variable per `scaleNames` entry. `generate-scale-variables` instead takes a `scaleRange: { from, to }`, so it is possible to generate 11 variables against a 7-entry `scaleNames` — after which the Style Manager preview and `regenerateVariables()` both map variables onto the wrong steps. `scaleRange: { from: -2, to: 4 }` matches a 7-name list with baseline at index 2.
- `generate-scale-variables` with `save: false` returns the generated variables for review; show these to the user and wait for approval before saving.
- `generate-scale-variables` does not support saving with `save: true`. Persist the
  previewed rows with `set-global-variables`, using one fresh
  `list-global-variables` response's `variableOwnership` and `categoryOwnership`.
  If the category itself must change, first send the complete preserved category
  list to `set-global-variable-categories` with both current ownership values,
  then re-read before saving variables.
- Global variables are stored in a global option, not post revisions. Use `delete-global-variable` for cleanup of individual variables; it returns a `beforeDelete` snapshot.
- `set-global-variables` is an upsert, not a full replacement. Pass both current
  variable/category ownership values. `set-global-variable-categories` is a full
  category replacement and also requires both current values. `delete-global-variable`
  requires the row's `itemOwnership` plus literal `allowOrphans: true` after review.

## Color palettes

- Palettes are ordered arrays of colors. Each color has an id, `light` and optional
  `dark` value, plus a `raw` CSS-variable reference; individual colors do not have a
  separate display-name field.
- **Formats usually round-trip.** Light and dark shades preserve the parsed base format. Transparent shades are emitted as HSL/HSLA because the builder's transparent-shade path changes alpha directly.
- Before creating a new palette, check whether the existing primary palette has the color. Fragmented palettes are the most common design-system mess.
- **Generating shades.** Use `bricks/generate-color-shades` to produce light, dark, or transparent ramps from a base color. The ability uses Bricks' PHP color helper, ported from the builder Color Shades popup, so previews should match the builder math. Shade `raw` names become `var(--{base-variable}-{l|d|t}-{index})` only when the base color has a `raw` value such as `var(--brand-primary)` or when `baseVariable` is passed. Without that variable reference, each generated shade keeps the base raw value. Preview with `save: false`, then pass that exact preview's `saveOwnership` as `expectedOwnership` when saving; the save replaces existing shades of the same type, parent, and mode.
- A color ramp is two-step: create the base color with a `var(--name)` reference, then call `generate-color-shades` for `light` and `dark` (typically 4-5 steps each). `transparent` is optional for tint overlays.
- Palette/color deletes require target item ownership. Deleting named CSS-variable
  colors or palettes also requires `allowOrphans: true`; run the reference audit but
  treat its bounded evidence as non-exhaustive.

## Theme styles

- **Theme styles do not apply without conditions.** A style with an empty conditions array is ignored by the normal theme-style matcher. Always set `conditions` when creating: use `[{ main: "any" }]` for a site-wide base, or a more specific condition such as `postType`, `ids`, `terms`, or `archiveType`.
- By default, Bricks applies the highest-scoring matching theme style. More specific conditions beat broad ones: `postType` beats `any`, and exact `ids` beats `postType`.
- If the Theme styles loading method setting is enabled, Bricks loads every matching theme style in score order. In that mode, broad styles load earlier and more specific styles load later.
- The first theme style on a fresh site should almost always be `conditions: [{ main: "any" }]` so defaults actually render.
- Theme styles are stored in a global option, not post revisions. Use `delete-theme-style` for cleanup; it returns the removed style in `beforeDelete`.
- Updates and deletes require the target style's current `itemOwnership`. Fetch the
  exact style with `get-theme-styles({ style: id })` before changing settings.
- Deleting a style that has settings or conditions additionally requires
  `acknowledgeStyleRemoval: true` after reviewing the returned bounded impact
  evidence. This acknowledgement belongs to delete, not update.

## Components

- **Labels are unique across all components.** `bricks_conflict_duplicate_component_name` on collision.
- Components carry their own element tree. External references to global classes and CSS variables inside that tree are preserved: if a component uses `.button` and `var(--space-m)`, those references follow it wherever it's instanced.
- **Deleting a component with non-zero `usageCount` leaves orphan pointers.** The builder renders missing components as a placeholder. Either replace the usages first or explicitly accept the orphans with the user.
- Prefer `extract-component-from-elements` over copying element trees. The extraction rewrites ids cleanly and swaps the source subtree to a component instance in one write, with a revision snapshot.

See the **bricks-components** skill for slots, nested components, and property binding specifics.

## Workflows

### Add a color ramp to an existing palette
1. `list-color-palettes`, then `create-color` with its resource ownership and the intended `raw` variable reference.
2. Preview `generate-color-shades` with `save: false`; re-run with `save: true` and the preview's `saveOwnership` as `expectedOwnership`.
3. Repeat for `dark` (and optional `transparent` for tints).
4. `list-color-palettes` to verify.

### Add or replace a scale
1. Pick the naming first (t-shirt or numeric) and stick to it across typography + spacing.
2. `generate-scale-variables` with `save: false`: review output with user.
3. Once approved, pass the returned rows to ownership-guarded `set-global-variables`.
4. `list-global-variables` to verify.
